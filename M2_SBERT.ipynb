When the display is not functioning correctly, the machine is unable to inform you when the filter is full and needs to be changed.  I would STRONGLY suggest ordering directly from Elkay.

You can fine-tune their defaults and my only complaint is that I wish it would remember the last setting and use it the next time around.

Luckly, we found an adapter on AMAZON, and it worked. In their description, they mention fits most faucets, you would think a standard faucet would be acceptable, NOT! Secondly, we opened the top load washer door, and it made a clicking noise.  We noticed a piece was broken off for easy to open and close.  Thirdly, the drain hose is very short and could not reach a sink.  Be prepared to buy TWO large buckets because you need them to drain out the water, which she poured into her shower and kitchen sink. We decided not to return the item after all our frustration because she loves it! She is willing to deal with the door malfunction.  Also, make sure you have a GFI plug.

Electrician said it is a problem with the oven.  He told me to check the fuse.  The fuse looked ok, but I changed it anyway.  Still DEAD!  I contacted Fagor and they said they would get back with me and let me know what they will do.  I did not hear from them, so I called them back.  The guy I spoke with was kind of SMUG and kept interrupting me.  He said they need to check their data base for a repair person.  I asked them how long could that take to get on their computer and find one and get this going.  I feel like I am getting the run around.  In the mean time, my new oven is sitting in the middle of my kitchen waiting for something to happen.  I read another post which sounded similar to mine, and their problem was the mother board was out.  Sounds like this might be a common problem.  I like the design of the oven.  I needed a small oven and I liked the side opening door.  I like the look of the oven.  However, it doesn't work and it appears cheaply made.  The gasket around the opening for the door is very thin and very cheap.  If I had to do over again, I would not order this oven.  I am going to contact Amazon and see what they will do about this.\n",

The top rack is easy to put up and down and has enough room that tall glass fit standing up. the very top rack works good for extra silver ware and spatulas and the like and seams to get them clean. The soap dispenser lid opens in a way that it won't get caught on dishes. The dishwasher is the quietest that I have ever owned and I didn't install all of the insulation under the door.

The three sets of LED lights are almost overwhelming....so I guess if it didn't work as a laminar flow hood I could use it as a spaceship but that's not what I wanted. The third photo is the back of the \"flow Hood\" where you can clearly see that part of the vent on top is not covered by a HEPA filter. The fourth photo I tried to show through those gaps on the top where you could see plain as day light from the other side.

You have to be near it to be able to feel it. The only drawback is that because the tank is at the top, the condensation dripped down onto the table. I'm not sure if the condensation will affect the machine in the long run. That is not something I considerate when purchasing it\n",

After fixing the slide we were able to mount the wood trim and the door worked fine.  I had a specific size I needed for my opening and I wanted something that really kept drinks cool so this was the only unit that did both.  When I had trouble with the wood trim, I called the company and they seemed really surprised we had this issue.  They would have taken care of the issue if I had not figured it out myself.\n",

It has many options and the oven heats quickly. You must stand back when you open the door of the heated oven. It can be overwhelming as the heat escapes.

If the unit won't start, be sure to return BOTH temperature and power controls to OFF.  Wait a few seconds, first turn on the power and then set the temperature.

It is adjustable if it wasn't to temperature. The delivery was on-time, but it was supposed to come with free installation and removing the old one. The delivery guys didn't even attempt it. They said they couldn't do the conversion to LP. They said they couldn't unhook the electrical and they could not unhook the gas line. And they definitely couldn't re-wire the stove back into the electrical box or re-hookup the LP gas line. In fact, they wanted to leave the old range where it sat and leave the new one in the living room. I said \"stand back\" while I grabbed a screwdriver and pipe wrench... while they watched. I finally said \"why don't you bring the other one in while I'd doing this? No biggie. The LP conversion was pretty easy with a nut driver.\n",
