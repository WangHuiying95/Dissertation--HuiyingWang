However, it was difficult to try to match the oven door handle in the pictures.  The handle shape looks like the original handle but upon closer review it is a more squared look inside the ends of the handle.  However, since my Fridgaire stove & oven is older & came with our house at purchase, we replaced the former handle with this new one anyway.  I am content at this point with it.  One concern is that these recommended screws were a \"tad\" too long but still provided a stable installation.  We removed the spacer that came with the screws.  It's been 2 weeks & I have baked twice with the new replacement.  It worked well. Further, I did not want any further delays to installing a new replacement.'\n",

When it initially arrived, it had been dropped in shipping and the top front panel was smashed.  I contacted GASLAND Chef customer service and explained circumstances.  After a few emails and pictures, they sent a replacement and it arrived beautiful and intact.  And the stars are for the customer service as well! We installed it in a few hours (the electric wires that came with were not long enough for our space so it took a bit longer than normal). We have only used a few times, but works great so far!  The manual that comes with is a little lacking in some information but we will figure it out. The cooking modes are also a little confusing but will also figure it out over time.  Overall, this little oven looks great and very modern.'\n",

It is massive, heavy and great internals (fan, grates, lighting controls and fan speed controls - even came with a spare control module).<br /><br />Buyers must understand - this is fabricated in China and is good work - language barrier can cause some misunderstanding but rest assured they will follow through - as example when I asked if the item had ‘shipped’ the response was yes - in this case my shipped was equal the packaging and crating of the unit and may not be in the hands of the shipping company.  Nevertheless Copper Tailor will send the shipping tracking number in a few days.  It takes about 2 months from the time you confirm the dimensions until you receive it so plan early and make accommodations - it is worth it - never thought a hood could look this great (hammered bronzed copper) and it even is a talking point of beauty for our guests.'\n",

Of course… OEM air filters were at least double the price.  So I got these two and placed them on each side. How I understand these work is say you were to place bananas in a brown paper bag, notice that they get ripe faster?  That is because the off-gassing of the banana is trapped and speeds up the process. This filter is supposed to remove these and other type gases through UV light. Supposedly this helps extend your fruits and vegetables by 1-2 weeks. If someone knows different please comment. It could just be some snake oil 🐍'\n",

            "Document Sentence: 'After using my brand new dishwasher for four times I noticed that the silverware in the cutlery tray was dirty. It's not just that it wasn't properly clean. It was dirty, greasy and you could even see the color of the food. (I don't think I put anything in the cutlery tray the first times I used the dishwasher). Some of the dishes in the lower tray (including a tall glass) are somewhat dirty too. I called Bosch customer care and was told that the dishwasher needs rinse aid in order to wash (so just adding dish washer detergent doesn't get you clean dishes) and that they will charge me for the work of the technician if lack of rinse aid is the problem. Note that the product information doesn't include that it only washes if rinse aid is added.<br />I'm now washing the same load of dishes now for a third time on a row in the hopes that it solves the problem but bottomline is (1) a dishwasher should be able to wash dishes only with adequate detergent, (2) if additional items are NEEDED for the dishwasher to wash this should be clearly stated as part of the description of the product, and (3) nothing excuses rude customer care that passes customers the burden for problems with brand new items.<br />In a subsequent call to BOSCH customer care I was told that the dishwasher should work without rinse aid. A technician came to check my unit and he said that this washer ONLY works with dishwasher tablets, even if that's not written anywhere and the guide that comes with the dishwasher says you can use liquid dishwasher. I still don't know if it'll work with those (he refused to try it and just left), but at any rate if this dishwasher ONLY works with these items, that information must be provided upfront so you decide if you want to buy it or not. I feel like I've been sold a car and later been told that the car only works if I wear a red shirt.<br />You can see in the picture what items look like AFTER THREE CONSECUTIVE WASH CYCLES!'\n",

I have been looking for it and this one catches my eyes , not only the size is perfect but also the price ! It is affordable , and after receiving it , it is too good for the price . It doesn’t have a super fancy look but it is simple enough to match my other appliances in the kitchen . It is not too heavy for a female to move it around . It has one adjustable thermostat that could be adjusted to whatever tempered you want . I love my dessert reefer , I hope it will last forever !'\n",

We thought the food would be sucked off the range!<br /><br />The keyhole mounting plates are not stud spaced (i.e.16&#34;), so the wall will need reinforcing behind the dry wall.  It cannot be mounted using drywall fixtures since it is too heavy.<br /><br />Also, at 760 CFM, you will need to install some form of makeup air system (most state building codes require make-up air for any hood over 400 CFM).  The reason is simple: if you are moving 760 CFM of air from inside the kitchen, then the same volume of air must enter the kitchen from somewhere!  In our case, the cost of the external vent and automated makeup air system linked to our heating/AC air ducting was over $1000!

            "Document Sentence: After running one load, I am satisfied. It cleans the clothes well, is (relatively) quiet, can operate both the washer and dryer at the same time, and it fits in the tiny space we have available. The biggest downside I can tell as of now is that the capacity is severely limited, which means that we will have to adjust our laundry habits to more frequent, smaller loads.<br /><br />The delivery was (extremely) early - they arrived at 7:30 AM when scheduled delivery was between 9 AM and noon. (My alarm to wake up for the delivery went off as they were finishing the installation.) The delivery contractors were very pleasant and efficient and installed the unit in an extremely tight space (see picture).<br /><br />One thing to note is that the plug is 20 amp (ground, one vertical, one horizontal) but fortunately our receptacle received it. It WILL NOT fit into a standard 15 amp (think living room outlet) receptacle without an adapter, but the user guide STRONGLY discourages use of one. It probably voids the warranty.<br /><br />Great machine for a great price. Probably the best value for a small space and 120 volt. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this product from Amazon again.\n",

            "Document Sentence: We needed a new washer and based on my research, I selected a front loading washer from Samsung.  I work in the field as a technician and get pretty dirty at times.  I wear wicking clothing as well as Carhartt dungarees. Additionally, 2 young kids living at home requires a lot of laundry.  I have noticed the clothing is cleaner and the technology is superior to the old agitator machine that we replaced.  One thing to note: I have noticed the lint filter in the dryer does not load up as much as before.  I think this is a testament to the fact the front loader tumbles the clothing and is not as hard on the fabrics as the agitator was.  I would certainly recommend the Samsung washer as a great appliance addition to someone's home. The 4.3 cubic feet capacity is another nice feature.  We are washing larger loads and including bedding that we sometimes washed by hand and then would hang it out to dry. The spin feature on the washer gets the water out before going into the dryer or out to hang dry.\n",

Luckly, we found an adapter on AMAZON, and it worked. In their description, they mention fits most faucets, you would think a standard faucet would be acceptable, NOT! Secondly, we opened the top load washer door, and it made a clicking noise.  We noticed a piece was broken off for easy to open and close.  Thirdly, the drain hose is very short and could not reach a sink.  Be prepared to buy TWO large buckets because you need them to drain out the water, which she poured into her shower and kitchen sink. We decided not to return the item after all our frustration because she loves it! She is willing to deal with the door malfunction.  Also, make sure you have a GFI plug.

The heavier the stuff, the less capable of getting all the water out, probably because it feels like it's going to break, so i don't push it very hard.<br /><br />I haven't even tried a bath towel yet but if i put 4 dish towels in it, spin it, then pull them out, there's still a lot of water that comes out when i hand wring it.<br /><br />So i spun 1 dish towel at a time and it was much better. But that is not a time saver at all.  I could've wrung it out faster by hand.<br /><br />That said, the lighter stuff worked decent. And on some things it seemed like it got more water out than i could have if i had rung by hand.<br /><br />Another thing that isn't great is that it's hard to get the clothes balanced and i had to put the thing between my feet and try to control the shaking around.<br /><br />The reason i almost think it may end up being a 4, is because for some things it was good, and sweaters was one of them. My sweaters dried probably 4 or 5 times faster because i was able to get almost all the water out.<br /><br />I'll be able to be 100% sure of what rating this deserves after i have a little more experience with it.\n",

I should have compared the part number on the OEM board.  Also, the PC board is 90 degrees rotated in the holding tray that it is glued to, and the screw hole is in the wrong place, compared to the original, and is missing one receptacle for a multi-contact wiring harness connector.  There's a good chance that this board might work because all the sockets are the same except one.  But perhaps a few of the control board functions will be disabled.  The refrigerator controls for this model series refrigerator comes in many variations, with differences in the features and what the user's touchpad can do.

The light doesn’t go on when the door opens, like every other refrigerator in the world. You either have to have it on all the time, or not at all; 2. The temperature does not stay where you set it. After a few days the unit always goes back to 46 degrees; and 3. For the controls for the light, temperature and locking the door you need to press the panel at a certain point. The problem is the panel is black, and has very faint outlines showing where to press. It is extremely difficult to see where to press as there is no button or tactile feel. Additionally, for temperature you need to press the panel in two places at the same time. It’s always hit or miss and takes time to figure out where to put your fingers.\n",

There is not a dealer or repair center for this oven anywhere near Texas.<br /><br />On the Pro side. It works exactly as promised. It cooks evenly and rapidly. It seems to be a terrific oven for pastries in convection mode with wonderful browning and crusts. It also is quite predictable in non-convection mode.<br />The only reason we bought this oven is our experience with other Fagor products. We love our Fagor Pressure Cooker and their counter-top convection oven/toaster is also wonderful. Of course, the universal 4 stars or better reviews for Fagor products was the real capper.\n",

I contacted Fagor and they said they would get back with me and let me know what they will do.  I did not hear from them, so I called them back.  The guy I spoke with was kind of SMUG and kept interrupting me.  He said they need to check their data base for a repair person.  I asked them how long could that take to get on their computer and find one and get this going.  I feel like I am getting the run around.  In the mean time, my new oven is sitting in the middle of my kitchen waiting for something to happen.  I read another post which sounded similar to mine, and their problem was the mother board was out.  Sounds like this might be a common problem.  I like the design of the oven.  I needed a small oven and I liked the side opening door.  I like the look of the oven.  However, it doesn't work and it appears cheaply made.  The gasket around the opening for the door is very thin and very cheap.  If I had to do over again, I would not order this oven.

Keeping in mind the inherent limitations of induction (ferrous cookware), we have loved cooking on this even more than anticipated.  Water boils in like half the time as our gas cooktop, and not only that, we can cook a whole pot of pasta and then lift the pot off to drain it without even using potholders.  Induction only heats the bottom surface, so the handles are still cool, and you could even put a piece of chocolate next to the pot on a working burner without it melting.  We tried this, to the delight of our young children.  It means that we don't need to worry about them getting burnt once they start experimenting in the kitchen.<br /><br />All in all, a great investment, and an energy-efficient way to cook.\n",

It was super easy to install. Remove the 3 screws in the front of the range holding the cooktop in place. Then remove the LED light (1 screw) located in the front of the glass that alerts you to a hot cooktop. Then remove 4 screws each on the two rows of burners and let them sit on the padding inside the range while you remove the old cooktop. Don't forget that the back burners have extra wires grounded by the screws when reinstalling. Just screw everything back in, make sure the cooktop lines up properly on both sides of the range (you can tell if it is too far to one side easily by a visual check), and then screw the 3 screws in the front to secure the top.

If the drain line (or disposal) plugs, drain water will back up into the inlets - it can't flow out the front of the cap into the sink.  Furthermore,  in my opinion the geometries of this gap are too small and prone to blockage by debris.<br /><br />There actually aren't a lot of dual dishwasher air gaps out there, but it turns out this manufacturer makes another model \"ET200-002\" which I'm much happier with, addresses issues noted above (vented to air, larger space for debris to flow) and drains far better.  Since it's not a sealed unit, ET200-002 does gurgle noticeably as it drains - but not overly so.  It is also a physically larger cap, sticks up a bit more off the counter.

            "Document Sentence: TL;DR - Works as intended. Affordable. Same installation as original. Has other uses.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Works exactly like the original, installs correctly. Only different between this one and the original is that it felt slightly lighter and is a different color than the original. Functionally, it's no different. If you somehow melt part of yours, it still functions well as part of your home defense.<br /><br />2) I accidentally ruined the first one, had to order a second. We kept our ruined first order on the counter near our front door. Lightweight enough that it's easy for even some disabled folks with some mobility issues to pick up, but with just enough weight you can get a good swing with it.<br /><br />3) Cats may try to chew on it, but will be unsuccessful at breaking off pieces, though we don't suggest testing this with a dog.<br /><br />4) Easier to see leftover debris/gunk buildup over time from normal dishwasher use.<br /><br />5) Cheapest we could find online. Couldn't find this particular model at local stores.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Much like the original, if not installed correctly, it will throw a fit like a toddler, drop onto the bottom, and have a meltdown. Read your manual. Double check behind yourself.<br /><br />2) If this comes in contact with the heating element, this does NOT smell good. You know that scene in \"Volcano\" with Tommy Lee Jones where in the subway, the guy is rescuing the unconscious subway car driver and as he's walking, his shoes are melting, as well as the rest of the car, from the lava that's pouring in under the car? That's what it smells like.\n",
            "Document Sentence: It was easy to install and works perfectly well. It looks a little odd because it’s white and the original was gray but it works!\n",
            "Document Sentence: Did not stay secure to mounting part. Spun off in first cycle and melted on end off by falling on heating element.  Yes it was the right part and it fit well  however the clips at the bottom that hold it in place and allow it to spin are not strong enough to keep it in place.\n",

That being said, the drawers are a little wobbly, not as sturdy as I would have hoped for but they will fix. Also, this runs...constantly and it makes hum/buzzing noise that is annoying, almost too much for in our kitchen. When the fan shuts off tho does so most of the time with a rather loud clunk.<br /><br />Update a year later, the top drawer glide does not work.  The drawer gets stuck and then you cant push it back in.  Also, the bottom drawer handle keeps coming off, with no way to make it secure.<br /><br />NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!\n",

They are not returning any communication at this point. DO NOT BUY this THOR fridge.<br /><br />No longer keeps things cool. Broke after just 7 months. Contacted Thor and it has to be uninstalled from under the counter in order for them to do a warranty claim since serial number is required and the sticker is on the back.

I was required to take a picture of the fridge as well as the cut cord for the unit. The fridge itself I get to dispose of. NewAir is supposedly sending me a new unit (at my expense) but gave me $10 off so I only have to pay $32. So, I get to pay nearly $900 for this wine cabinet but also get to dispose of a broken one, and PAY for a new one to replace the one I bought less than a year ago.

The ventless is good if you don’t have an existing vent. I preferred my old vented Axxis to this one but Bosch stopped making vented ones.<br />If you have pets regular maintenance is needed. You have the regular lint trap to clean and since the mesh is so fine and you use dryer sheets you have to scrub it periodically to get rid of the wax build up or it will, clog, overheat, and shut down—requiring a maintenance call to pay someone a lot of money to take off a back panel and push a button. Then you have to periodically clean the condenser which builds up hair and lint. If you don’t, the dryer becomes inefficient and eventually stops drying. Washing the condenser in your sink or tub will wash a bunch of hair down the drain leading to potential clogs. Finally you have to clean the sump—where the moisture from you condenser goes. If not, the pump clogs and the water pools and your clothes don’t dry. This is the trickiest one to clean as it is in the way back and the sump cover is a pain in the butt to open. If you are not handy and own this dryer, you will be regularly paying someone a lot of money to do basic maintenance.<br />Note: the default dry setting are a bit damp for someone like me who has dust allergies. You can make it dry more by using the “dry level” button. Be careful because your laundry can get hot and synthetics will off gas and cottons can smell burnt.\n",

            "Document Sentence: It is a basic filter which fits and works.  I can't knock that at all.  My first issue is that one filter was stuck to the cardboard box and some paper from the cardboard was adhered to the rubber gasket part.  I just put that at the bottom where the bottom locking disk misses that stuck paper and it didn't effect the performance or the seal.  My other issue may seem petty, but the main picture in the listing shows a cleaning brush for getting in the pleats.  I expected that would be included, but when the package arrived, just the two filters.  There is no real description in this listing, so it was never actually promised, just seems pretty cheap of the seller that they would show it but not include it in the order.  Not a deal-breaker, and I will keep them, but I'll probably order from a different seller next time who actually bothers to include a description and list what is included.<br />Over-all it is acceptable but not great, thus 3 stars.\n",

If you want to see a great video for replacing it, especially to see which wire goes where since they've moved and are not labeled (you can also compare the male pin sizes, one is wider than the other), look on YouTube for GE Refrigerator Repair - How to Replace the Start Device.<br /><br />I'll add a few comments:<br />- I had to bore out the hole slightly in the guide for my start capacitor (the black module that you need to swap between the devices).  It does not go in very smoothly to begin with and I couldn't tell if I was pushing against the guide post or the pins themselves. There's no reason for it to be that tight to begin with, it's only there to make sure you orient it correctly.  I suspect the post on the new device was barely bigger than the original.<br />- In the video, you can see there's still a small gap between capacitor and relay after connecting them, that's how mine was too (see pic).<br />- After replacement, I was not able to reinstall the retaining clip, the whole assembly is bigger than original.  That shouldn't matter since I don't plan on moving my fridge very much.<br />- My relay was upside down from the one shown in the video, yours might be too.\n",

Very nice ceramic work - yet simple in design and easy to operate. Easy to install - once you drop it in, there are only 3 wires to connect. It was also nice to encounter ACCURATE \"cutout\" dimensions - fits like a glove. My wife loves the ease of operation. The price was competitive, considering quality and functionality. (Note: Our experience was that 30\" units in $600 - $800 range were pretty substandard - we first bought a GE stove top for $550 and the temperature was totally uncontrollable.) Realistically, since we only have had this SMEG for a couple weeks, only time will tell regarding long term operation/durability. But for now, we are very happy; my only criticism is the overly brief manual that made it a challenge to learn the operational characteristics (Hint: a lighted \"H\" does not indicate a \"high\" temperature setting; it means the burner you just turned off will remain hot until the red light goes out.).

(2) Buying this trash compactor on amazon is A LOT ($200-$300) than purchasing it direct from Krushr. This is because Krushr charges you hundreds of dollars to ship this. GIven multiple complaints elsewhere regarding Krushr customer service, I saw no purpose in purchasing this direct from Krushr vs from Amazon. (3) Compactor came without any damage.<br /><br />Bad: (1) Installation. Holy hell. The installation instructions are TERRIBLE and you can literally not put the door on this without drilling through metal to make your own screw holes. (2) The toe kick cannot be applied unless you raise it 5-6inches above the ground. Meaning anything less than that, you are going to see a big hole underneath when viewed from the side.

No tangles in the past few weeks of use.  I think it does do some reverse tumbling at some point in the cycle, which may help prevent the laundry from tangling.

            "Document Sentence: This p/n# 1903 radiant does fit a  24\"x24\" NAT gas char-broiler pefectly with no modification.  The description has this item at 13\" in length and 1lbs and both of those numbers are wrong.  It's closer to approx 17\" and several pounds.  On the other hand, The US-Range item p/n# 1902 also available on amazon is longer at approx19.5 overall length, and not the 21\" it is k<br />Listed as either, but otherwise they are exactly the same thing, and the longer 1902 would have to be trimmed or otherwise modified to fit properly from front to back over each of the burners.  I've purchased both at different times and that's what I've learned.  Hope that helps anyone thats confused about these two similar products.  If you don't mind cutting a 4\"x4\" section of cast iron then the cheaper longer 1902 will give you the material to get it done with your finishing touch of the final shaping.<br /><br />If you don't want to put in all that effort with a hand saw, sawzall, or cutoff tool / angle grinder to cut the cast iron, you could always score it as deep as possible with a cutoff wheel or diamond file and then pop into the freezer for approximately 30 min and when you pull it out, quickly put it in a bench vise, and whack it really hard very quickly, with a large hammer.  I use a 4lbs eastwing crosspein and it does a great job.  Sometimes it does  help to put some tension on both sides of the score mark with the vise and a pair of channel locks, and then hit with the hammer on the side with the channel locks while pulling or pushing up or down at 90° to the length of the radiant, and it should break.  When it does break it usually is a surprisingly clean break.  (This will only work on brand new cast iron. If it's been heated or seasoned it either won't snap, or you won't be able to control where it breaks it could break farther up the radiant and not where you intended. I have learned this from trial and error over 18 years in the service repair industry.  It is best to just cut it with a cut off wheel on a grinder though) ,as long as you remove from the freezer and place in the vice and hammer it as quick as possible so it doesn't warm up, it should snap the portion off that you have held with the channel locks. Just remember to put pressure on it as you hit it with the hammer. Hit it like you mean it, hard.  If you don't it may not break.  If you do it correctly it's pretty easy.  We also the old warped ones that are stuck in place by breaking them with the hammer.  That's how I discovered this approach in the first place. It just doesn't break anywhere specific usually they tend to shatter or break into several pieces.  I hope this helps answer any questions somebody might have.\n",

I just set a time for 30-minutes and turn it back to 200 - I just use the hot setting because hot, isn't that HOT<br />It was easy to hoist up the stairs by myself - I just slid it up on its side.

After much frustration trying to find one locally (and having to return a new one that wouldn't fit) I ordered this one since it's ADA compliant and as such it would fit.  It did.  However, there are some annoying and surprising design flaws in this machine.<br />In no particular order....<br />First, there is NO water dispensing from the very top (ceiling) of the tub.  I'm not sure how the tops of items in the top rack or supposed to be cleaned. Every other DW we've ever had has a circulating dispenser above AND below the top rack.  This one just has below.<br />Secondly, the racks seem to be very poorly designed.  The vertical holders on the bottom rack are too short and too close together to hold anything except plates.  You can put several plates (though I wouldn't put them THAT close together) but no pots or pans.  The top rack is useless for holding light glasses or really much of anything, again due to the very shallow vertical posts on the rack.<br />Third. It does not dry, at all!  We've tried multiple settings including heat dry and everything is still soaking wet.<br />On at least one cycle the detergent dispenser didn't open and the water didn't drain.  We've only used it a handful of times so hopefully this doesn't recur.<br />Overall dishes do NOT come out clean.<br />Overall VERY disappointed in the performance and utility of what to us, was far from a 'cheap' dishwasher.  I was hesitant to buy something like this online and sight unseen.  Sometimes you just have to learn those lessons I guess...  Had I purchased this locally it would definitely be going back.<br />The only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 is because it is quiet.  Significantly more so than our previous one.  I suppose if you're not going to do a good job, you can ate least be quiet about it.  So I guess that's worth 'something'.\n",

The metal knobs are durable and well constructed—however, their so close to the burner as to make them a burn hazard when cooking. There's also the metal grate, which again is an excellent idea; however, the lack of corner support means it's easy to tip a smaller pot if you're not careful when moving them around the cooking surface. The one last issue I have is that with an appliance gas regulator, the burner output for the big burner is meager. In contrast, the smaller burner is a rocket, which, combined with the poor valve controls, means you are either boiling or simmering.\n",

Definitely a good experience so far.  Imp. Note:  I have NOT yet cleaned this unit, so I gave it an \"expected\" 4 star rating for cleaning, since it has small spaced BETWEEN the baffles, I'm anticipating the need for a little more time/work to get it clean in there - BUT, that extra effort should be more than worth the VALUE of having many more baffles, closer together, which so far, seems a MUCH better \"air cleaning\" design (ie. more baffles, closer together).\n",

The top rack is easy to put up and down and has enough room that tall glass fit standing up. the very top rack works good for extra silver ware and spatulas and the like and seams to get them clean. The soap dispenser lid opens in a way that it won't get caught on dishes. The dishwasher is the quietest that I have ever owned and I didn't install all of the insulation under the door.

After installing the front filter without much issue I moved onto the top filter, only to discover that its impossible to install it if you have the BH2 case with handles (the inside screws get in the way). I could not push down on the top of the case enough to screw it back into the rest of the chasis. When I attempted to add the back filter i discovered why; these filters are intended to be affixed to the EXTERIOR of the case. I only realized this at all because the back filter is not a standard rectangle and could not stick to the inside of the case at all.<br /><br />In short, if you don't mind ugly stick on, cheap feeling filters GO FOR IT. Otherwise it might be a better idea to DIY a solution for dust prevention.<br /><br />Can't even return the kit cause I broke one of the adhesive magnets (yea it uses magnets too) trying to remove it from my case so I could close it properly.\n",

(They had a blue dot on one of the fuses (instead of the thermostat), an Orange dot on the other fuse, and no dots on the thermostat.)  Anyway, after some research, I used the white fuse with the orange dot; which is for an electric washer/150 degrees.

The only tools that you will need are a small crescent wrench and a utility knife (or other suitable cutting tool) if you desire to shorten the length of the tubing, or to install an inline water filter.  The supplied PEX 1/4\" tubing is superior to standard milky white polyethylene tubing, as is far more crush resistant and durable.  With the supplied quick-connect fittings, no annoying metallic compression fittings are necessary, and they can be safely disconnected and reused if necessary.  The shut off valve connects easily to a standard under-sink shut off valve with a 3/8\" compression male outlet feeding the cold water supply line to your kitchen faucet.

As pictured on site, with all parts still in cardboard inside. Not a scratch or dimple anywhere. Carefully study instructions for door removal (and installation) to reduce installation weight, if doing it yourself. Thermador's pictographs are a little vague. Also recommend an electrician hook up since it's 220. We paid $175 for a electrician to bring 3 burly guys to lift and install, including installation of a new properly grounding box (the grand old Thermadors, 59 years old, had been installed before modern codes). On first startup expect a little smoke. Not sure if that's moisture or manufacturing oils etc. It had no strong smell. Just prepare to open windows or run your furnace/ AC fan a while (1/2 hour).

            "Document Sentence: To light the oven, you have to open the door all the way, turn the knob on full, and once the gas is lit, you have to wait a few moments to set the temperature you want, or the flame will go out. If you do it wrong, the oven will still release gas without lighting it. This strikes me as being extremely dangerous in a household appliance, particularly when most gas ovens let you just set the temperature, and everything works. I am astonished that they manufacture and sell an oven without safety interlocks to keep the oven from filling the house with gas.<br />I have only had it one day, but have already had to reset the clock several times, because it loses the time, resets itself to 12:00, and starts blinking. It seems to keep time for maybe an hour or so.<br />The instruction manual is very poorly written, and has two sections on how to set the clock. One of them is for how to set minutes, the other is for how to set hours, but you kind of have to figure that out for yourself.<br />The temperature settings are printed around the outside edge of the dial, making it very difficult to see what the temperature is set at unless you are right next to the oven. They should have been printed on the face of the dial so they could be seen from a few feet away.<br />This was the only 30\" gas wall oven I could find, so I took a chance on it. I regret that decision, and wish I had gone with electric, because then I would have had a better selection.<br />Since I had to wait for a custom cabinet to be made, I was past the return time when I discovered these issues. Now I am stuck just eating the cost of this terrible product and installing something else that will not put my family at risk.<br />UPDATE - got it taken out, installed an electric oven in its place. I am much happier without this explosion waiting to happen in my kitchen. But I am still stuck with this terrible product taking up room in my garage, because I cannot in good conscience sell it to someone else and put them at risk.\n",

            "Document Sentence: We just received the refrigerator after a month of delays on shipping, even though it was Amazon Prime. Plugged in the refrigerator and stopped blowing cold after one day. Normally a return with Amazon is not a big deal but when it is a large appliance it becomes a big challenge. They can give a you a refund but what to do with a refrigerator that doesn’t work! I had to pay someone to get it into the room and now will have to pay someone to take to the dump. You see many other reviews that the unit does not blow cold air and I should have listened. Avoid this refigerator!!\n",

            "Document Sentence: After talking to a couple of friends who happen to be mycologists I was informed that this is not a laminar flow hood, it will never work for mycology as described in the description, and I was taken advantage of by the seller. The fans are in front of the filter instead of behind it and it's a bad design. The three sets of LED lights are almost overwhelming....so I guess if it didn't work as a laminar flow hood I could use it as a spaceship but that's not what I wanted. The third photo is the back of the \"flow Hood\" where you can clearly see that part of the vent on top is not covered by a HEPA filter. The fourth photo I tried to show through those gaps on the top where you could see plain as day light from the other side. If any air is not going through the HEPA filter and being blown out through the front it's definitely not sterile.\n",

Please note, when it says it comes with one replacement biosponge, that means you get the one sponge that you use with your first install.  Other than that, it installed pretty easily.  I did need to pop in some metal tabs on the side of ceiling frame that holds the filter, so that it could install fully.  Those tabs are there to hold up the flimsy paper filters.  All in all seems like a great product, you get a 5 dollar coupon on purchase of next biosponge, and 20% off next purchase of a filter, if you have multiple filters, this is a great thing.\n",

            "Document Sentence: My dryer stopped working one day last week. The display would turn on, and I could select different cycles, but the time setting wouldn't change, and the dryer wouldn't start. It also wouldn't turn the door light on. I tried a factory reset, left the dryer unplugged for extended periods of time, and cycled through the diagnostic mode error codes, but the only error code I saw was \"E\" then \"Hd\".<br /><br />So, I found this board on a repair help website and ordered it. Replacement took about 25 minutes end-to-end. I had to remove the top panel, then remove the door, then the front panel (disconnecting two harnesses in the process). Once I'd reversed my steps and reconnected everything, I plugged the dryer back into the wall, then powered it on and was immediately able to run the dryer again.<br /><br />Will update if/when the dryer fails again.\n",

I needed it to connect to my faucet.  For some reason, it shakes really bad on the spin cycle of Delicate, but not on Permanent Press.  Because of the bad shaking, it sometimes moves away from the sink, which causes the outlfow hose to come out of the sink, pouring water all over my kitchen flow.  Otherwise, I'm happy with the washing capability.\n",

A plug came out at the bottom and it took me about 3 months to figure the problem which  caused the machine to leak out water.

You have to be near it to be able to feel it. The only drawback is that because the tank is at the top, the condensation dripped down onto the table. I'm not sure if the condensation will affect the machine in the long run. That is not something I considerate when purchasing it\n",

Sometimes after pulling the cord it would start back washing for months.  Pulling the cord to reset started becoming lesser of a solution over the next year.  Finally, it would only show the 8888.

However, having only used side by side refrigerators for the past 43 years this one is going to take some getting used to.  The entire top being just refrigerator (very roomy) and the entire bottom being not only freezer but a pull out freezer with no bottom to the drawer itself (only one large wire basket) is really a different mind set.  I like the ice maker which is nice and compact and the smaller adjacent freezer drawer is nice as well.

Most range hoods have a bracket that attaches to the wall and then the hood drops into the bracket almost like a french cleat.

We are very pleased with the capacity of this portable unit, it cleans small loads of laundry really well, and it is not unduly noisy, even during the spin cycle.  Would have given it 5 stars (for value and quality of performance) but for one key issue:  The product info on the Amazon site doesn't warn that the drainage hose empties from the BOTTOM of the unit, and therefore, you cannot drain it upward to an adjacent sink; you need a low level or floor drain for it, which we didn't have.  We had to place the portable on top of our old wide and flat washing machine (completely stable) so the drainage hose could drain into the laundry room sink.  Thankfully, then the intake water hose (at the top of the unit) was just long enough to reach the nearby water valve.  Note that there are other somewhat more expensive portables on Amazon with drain hoses that drain upwards from the top of the unit.\n",

I really wanted to be able to adjust the light levels and also wanted the nice stainless removable filter plates (rather than the icky mesh ones) and this range hood was one of the few that fit the bill on both accounts.<br /><br />At night, the nightlight automatically turns on, which I love. There is also a bright light setting and a medium light setting in addition to the nightlight (so three levels of light). There are also three levels on the fan, but we mainly use the lowest level. It is a bit on the loud side, but it does a decent job of removing the steam/smoke.<br /><br />The installation wasn't too difficult (our kitchen is set up to vent out the back with a rectangular vent). The power cord is in the back, so the hole for the cord through the cabinet isn't super noticeable. The range hood fits snugly in the 30\" opening so there are no large gaps on either side.<br /><br />I am happy with this range hood, both with how it looks and how it works.\n",

This belt number came up from a supply vendor and of course, the shipping wouldn't be fast enough, but this Amazon seller could get it out in a day which they did and that was awesome. Overall, when comparing my machine's belt to the one received, they were two different belts and a difference of a few millimeters which made it impossible to install. I'm sure that the belt is sufficient for another model but in my case it wasn't.

            "Document Sentence: We had a 28 yr. old Kenmore Agitator 3.2 cu. ft. Washer. It was a good washer. But...loud. and shook like crazy. Even when level. It died.<br />We cried.<br />I searched and researched hard for this machine. We only have 26” width to work with. There were a couple options out on the market. If you're reading this. You probably know what they are.<br />I could not find too many bad reviews on this machine. The price was in our price point.<br />UPS delivered 1 day early. YES!!!<br />The box was in pretty good shape. The machine did not have a scratch or dent on it (thank you UPS!) Hooked it up to permanent hot, cold, drain that night. Not gonna be moving it around.<br />We have only done 5 loads in it so far. But I have to say. No shake and bake going on any more. Our coffee cups (hanging on hooks on the other side of the wall) are already showing less chips and cracks.<br />Quiet. Nice and quiet. We don't have to turn our TV up to 17 any more. Actually watched The Commanders win (shocked!)with the volume at 7.<br />Our clothes are coming out nice and clean. Never had a machine where I could see the color of the water before. Thank gosh! The transparent lid on this machine lets you watch the progress of your load. Holy crap! Our clothes get freakin dirty!!<br />The spin cycle works great. Our clothes are coming out damp. Not wet. That saves time on our 28 year old dryer. (Can you say...\"what's your next appliance to replace\"?)<br />We are very happy with this Avanti machine so far.<br />Easy hook up.<br />If an appliance can look good. It does.<br />Quiet.<br />Good spin.<br />Gets the dirt out. Can see that through the transparent lid.<br />Fits where we needed it to.<br />Have no clue about energy efficiency though. Haven't had it long enough to tell. But! I'm sure our power company will be the first to let us know!!<br />Have only done 5 loads in it so far. If I remember (don't bet on it). I'll come back and update our review<br /><br />Update:<br />Still working great!<br />The machine has not done any \"walking\" around.<br />No leaks.<br />Still quiet.<br />Still making lots of dirty water with nothing but clean damp clothes coming out.<br />Our old Kenmore had an agitator in it.

            "Document Sentence: I bought this from the Amazon warehouse for less than $10. For that price it's amazing. That deal definitely clouds my view of the value. I doubt I would be willing to pay more than $40-50 new.<br /><br />Loudness - I use it in the kitchen near the sink, it is loud, but not unbearably so. If you used it in the bathroom and shut the door I don't think the loudness would be much of an issue.<br /><br />Lint - You have to be very careful about not mixing \"lint shedding\" fabrics with \"lint collecting\" ones. I made the mistake of washing a black t-shirt with a terry cloth bath towel. The shirt came out looking like i rolled around in goose down. I suggest buying a floating lint catching mesh bag, they work very well. If you drain it into the sink i would also recommend attaching a sock or panty hose to the drain spout to collect lint. You don't want that stuff collecting in your pipes.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/Hestya-Household-Reusable-Washing-Floating/dp/B07D79XPCN/ref=sr_1_5?<br /><br />Difficult to open/close - We needed two people to open the machine. It's good that it's difficult to open/close though because it makes it very sturdy. It would be a disaster if it collapsed while running a load. You can open it by yourself if you can gently set your foot inside the machine and pull up.<br /><br />Lid shakes off - This is the biggest annoyance, if you add even one washcloth too much the items will repeatedly knock the lid off. Not having the lid is not an option since the water splashes a lot. I tried setting a brick on the lid but it vibrated off into the water. If this happens just remove some items or maybe try using clamps on opposite sides of the machine.<br /><br />Doesn't walk while running - Some machines that vibrate like this have a tendency to walk themselves off the counter while running. This one does not, it's very stable.<br /><br />Drain stopper is sturdy, doesn't open itself during the cycle which I was worried about.<br /><br />Cleaning - After I'm done with washing and have drained the grey water I close the stopper, add about 2 quarts of warm water and use a paper towel to wipe down the walls. I drain then leave the lid off so the machine can air dry.<br /><br />Overall it's a good product if you can find it on sale. I would not pay $70 for it though.\n",

            "Document Sentence: This is a bit of a mixed review.  First off the unit I received was damaged in transit.  Although well packaged and with no apparent damage to the box it arrived in, the blower housing was broken in two places.  Of course this was only discovered by the crew remodeling our kitchen on the day they were ready to install the cooker hood. The blower motor housing was made of plastic and attaches to the top of the housing with four screws.  That's the end of the bad news.<br /><br />The good news is that Futuro Futuro technical service was brilliant.  I sent photos of the damaged parts by email,  Within a couple of hours I got a profuse apology email reply with a tracking number of a replacement blower that was dispatched 2-day air to me.  The replacement blower came with a light alloy casting instead of plastic.  Fitting was a bit fiddly but straight forward.  Four screws and two electrical plugs.<br /><br />Things I like.  It is QUIET! Well on the low and middle settings it is.  It's a beautiful piece of engineering and the fit and finish are superb.  Clever magnetic catches keep the lovely brushed stainless steel panel in place below the filters.  These are easy to remove and pop in the dishwasher to clean.  The LED lights are nice and bright, but it would be nice to be able to choose the color temperature to match our other under counter lights.  The remote control - who would have thought - is great and means that you don't have to put your hands above the pans on the range when cooking to control the extractor fan.<br /><br />All in all very pleased with this cooker hood.\n",

            "Document Sentence: The packaging is a joke, it was 6 flat pieces of cardboard taped together to make a box. I picked it up at a FedEx location and it was already falling apart. Opened up the packaging and the product was damaged in multiple areas but not enough to go through the return/exchange process, but was still upsetting. The product is made of high quality stainless steel. I'd call description of this product false advertising, the interior sticker of the product clearly states maximum air moved by this unit to be 1000 CFM, not the advertised 1800 CFM. The unit came with 2 IR heat lamps, however the advertised LED lighting is also false, they are 3 G9 based halogen bulbs, which is another disappointment. The unit does a decent job venting as a 1000 CFM hood. Baffles are stainless like in the restaurant kitchen hoods. The control panel is touch sensitive which controls the lighting, fan speed, kitchen timer, and timed shut off of the fan. The panel displays a clock with is comical to see when you set it, an hour later it goes 5 hours forward, this did not effect the kitchen timer however, that beeps for a minute after going off. On the right side of the unit are two manual switches that operate the heat lamps, which work good if you have a shelf on the back-splash of the range like in a professional kitchen, keeping pans and dishes warm. The heat-lamp switch placement seems like it was an after-though and should have been integrated into the touch panel.<br /><br />I emailed and messaged (through Amazon site) the company multiple times with out a reply. I called in to speak to a rep (the Amazon &#34;guy&#34;) who knew nothing about the product and he said he would provide me with a manual that came with the product. No reply thereafter, and got no information. I should have gone with my gut and got another highly reviewed and rated product instead of taking a chance on a product with no reviews and no customer service by Web Direct Brands. Fail. I should have returned the product when it was returnable due to product damage and  the false information in the description. I still own the product, and it works for what its worth (not much and definitely not at this price), since we were in a rush to get a working kitchen. I feel like we have compromised our quality and standards by owning this product.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product, it is not as advertised, company has no customer service and knowledge of this product.

Well, these drip pans are everything ALL the rest were not! FINALLY!! I had given up hope, thinking, I might have to fabricate my own crude drip pans (my wife put her foot down against that suggestion!) Well here they are folks!

            "Document Sentence: I have replaced so many igniters and temp gauges on my gas wall oven (from day 1) as the American Range tech guy told me this regulator rarely ever fails.  At first I was able to do  this under warranty but the oven never worked properly, always shutting itself off midway through cooking and burning out igniters after 3 months.  American Range had no answers for me and claimed they had never heard of this problem. After 4 years of my gas oven grief and over 2200 dollars of replacing igniters, gauges, and other parts,  it turns out it was this part was faulty from the beginning and caused all my other problems. I gave up ordering parts from American Range themselves as they took forever to deliver.  This was the final part I replaced after replacing all others and it finally got the oven working. It was my seventh service attempt. So for the last 3 months everything works great, just as it should have from the beginning. The part is authentic and arrived fast.<br />However, I would never buy another appliance from this company. There is only a small service staff in California and they know nothing about the engineering or complex diagnostic issues. The real engineers are in Mexico and don't communicate with Americans so if you have a problem like mine the staff are baffled and no-one can help you. They will also never replace an appliance that is faulty nor a part that is faulty. Also know that if you buy an American Range gas wall oven you will need two repair persons to remove it entirely from the wall to access the back even for ignitor replacement. (It is not a true consumer model like that of other companies which can be repaired from the front.)  This has been the most frustrating appliance I have ever owned. I will update this review if this part fails.\n",

OEM bearings have metal cover washers, these have plastic, I don't think they will last as long. Adding a few images of bearings, dimensions and the markings on the boxes. Hope these help.<br /><br />Installing the seal gasket takes a few minutes, hammering one side pops the other. This is normal for all seals, just keep on pressing all sides. I put extra lithium grease on the bearing and used \"Form-a-gasket sealant\" around the outer edges of the seal. This seems to help keep it in place. It took me about three hours to replace the bearing with more time on cleaning the drum.\n",
            "Document Sentence: This bearing is so loud, it sounds completely dry, when the washer is spinning i cant even hear the tv when im sitting in the living room. The washer is in the utility room thru the kitchen which is open to the living room. And yes, it is installed correctly, and no, i did not push on the inner ring when i installed it. Im a mechanic by trade and used a socket that fit the outer ring to seat the bearing. The seals are doing well, but the bearing is rubbish.

My only complaint is that it does not work well when cooking on a regular stove top, it's concave/convex surface and size does not rest or center well on stove. I recommend it for use as outdoor cooker on turkey fryer, charcoal/propane grill or wood fire, but, not a stove top cooker.

            "Document Sentence: I have an extensive culinary background and this Zline stove and oven is one of the best I’ve ever used.  I bought the four burner, 30 in stove to hold me over while going through a major remodel. My kitchen plans call for a 6 burner cook top and separate double oven. Zline makes beautiful products. I am waiting for my hood which will a Zline stained wood one. Now, I’m trying to figure out how to keep this stove too. My plans were to just sell it when the new stove was being installed. It will be hard to get rid of now.<br />It arrived on a wood pallet heavily packed.  It came with two oven doors too. One in white and one in stainless. Solid high quality doors . The racks in the oven glide. The oven takes a full sheet pan too! The cook top has four burners with four different cooking options. From high and fast to a slow and low simmer. Three very solid grates go on top. Pans heat quickly. I use both all-clad and Viking pans and cooking is dream.  I cannot say enough about the quality.  Wolf cost $4-$5,000 more and the quality is the same.  Zline is designed right here in America in South Lake Tahoe .  I have a medical practice and I have many contractors and builders that I treat. I talked to them about appliances they install. Zline is the choice of many builders . It is becoming more and more known. My new kitchen will have all Zline products. The range hoods are beautiful too.  Another selling point for me was how quickly it is available.  Depending on your skill level you may need and installer. I hired a contractor to install mine. It’s a very heavy, 200 lbs stove. It requires both gas and electricity. The oven bakes on two levels, low baking or high heat baking. I’m learning the difference now.  It’s a dream to cook and bake with. I have so little time to cook. I work long hours . This new stove makes cooking very easy to throw some home cooked food together now.  No more DoorDash! Ok less DoorDash.<br />Buy this stove !\n",

Once I realized it's not supposed to sound like that, I removed the shipping bolts which they put in to protect it in transit, it has worked perfectly.

            "Document Sentence: The part fixed the compressor start problem. Also replaced the start capacitor that has to be ordered separately. The make of refrigerator repaired is an 11 yr old whirlpool side by side. For about 2 weeks, a random “Click” could be heard from the kitchen. Finally found the source which was the compressor failing to start, then starting with one retry a minute later. This noise was the overload tripping. Once the compressor restarted it sounded fine. An ac volt meter in the open plug on the outlet powering the fridge showed a 2V dip which confirmed a high load during the failed start attempt. Condition worsened and finally the compressor would<br />not start on the retry. Compressor was warm but the condenser fan was free and ran at normal rpm so let it cool for a couple hours and vacuumed out the coils while waiting. Tried it again and it still would trip the overload. The power pins on the compressor had ballpark resistance readings for the start and run windings so the possibilities were locked compressor, system restriction or the start relay/capacitor. Since it sounded fine when it was intermittent, I went with the Relay/Capacitor. Guessed correctly, 5 minutes to snap on the new part and secure the compressor cover and job done. It took longer to vac out the condenser coils as the center set is miserable to reach. Total repair cost &lt;$95.00, part arrived in 3 days.<br />Hint: Look up the number printed on the original relay and cap to insure the correct replacement parts. Only tool required was a 5/16 nut driver to remove the rear cover panel.\n",

This also makes it easier to grab an egg when you need it, without having to shuffle through other items in your fridge.<br /><br />Another advantage of using an egg organizer is that it can help you keep track of how many eggs you have left.

The board was quite different from the original and when he tried to connect it.  part of the frig worked and part didn't.

If you pull off all the plastic cover, the filter will get ripped off too so the only other choice is to cut the plastic off with scissors and leave some of the plastic on. What a joke. I put the replacement filter in my expensive blueair filter frame just to see if it even fit and it did. I immediately pulled it out as I'm not going to run the machine and risk the plastic that is impossible to remove melting all over the machine and as I took it out the filter separated itself from the housing and fell everywhere. Also, it was a lot lighter in weight than normal and the ridges looked nothing like the real blueair filter. I am all about buying aftermarket products but this could have been made better by a 5 year old. I won't make that mistake again. I also want to add to the other person that commented on blue air that no where in the description did it say it was made by blueair. It's not the fault of Blueair, it's the fault of whatever criminal that passed this off as being anything more than a piece of trash. Don't waste you money on this brand and shame on Amazon for letting them sell on here.\n",

            "Document Sentence: This review is posted five days after receiving and using the oven. The seller is communicative and supportive. The delivery timing from the trucking company was a little difficult to anticipate. However we were able to have the oven received properly at the house.<br /><br />The Amazon installers who we hired have had difficulty getting the oven properly set-up. The oven continues to have a light smell of natural gas. **Update: We called Verona customer service and they quickly pointed out the installer had probably improperly tightened one of the two connection points (and/or cracked a gasket).  We decided to install new  gaskets and reconnect ourselves.  Thus far, no leaks or smell of gas! **<br /><br />We are not professional bakers. The oven and stove dials are large and easy to use however they do not necessarily operate like typical \"consumer grade\" American ovens.  The oven seems to heat evenly although we did get an oven thermometer as the scale provided on the front of the oven doesn’t seem to precisely correspond with the dial on the oven. Note: the over doesn't have a \"pre-heat\" ready chime. It does have a timer.<br /><br />We will post an update after a month of usage.<br />Update 1: one week of use\n",
            "Document Sentence: It was a little unsettling to order such an expensive item sight-unseen but the Verona gas range met all of our expectations. It's well-made, stylish, and most importantly works really well. Our previous range was a Garland professional gas range that was about 50 years old. The new features in the Verona have made cooking more enjoyable. The cook top cleans so easily and the burners produce a nice range of flame so you can find the right burner for the job. The convection range is very quick to preheat and cooks evenly, and the broiler is very powerful. We feel very spoiled and love using it every day. Also, kudos to the manufacturer. The gas regulator valve was not packed in shipping so they over-nighted one so we would be up and running. It was a fluke but they addressed it professionally and quickly. The directions to connect it were clear and easy to follow too. Zero complaints after over one month of use!\n",

The shipper was kind enough to reship another motor out quickly without a return. Overall, the install went smooth and it worked.

I was worried this would make laundry a never ending chore since it takes small loads, but so far it has been just fine! I’m using the condenser option for the dryer and have only had one load come out too damp—and that’s because I overloaded it. When I keep the loads smaller, the dryer works great. Loads take 2 to 3 hours but I still get all my laundry done in a day and that lasts me for the week. Would recommend to anyone who is single or just a couple. Gets the job done and takes up little space. I love it!\n",

I knew the LG would have been better but I didn't know just how bad this one was.<br /><br />______________________<br />Original review<br />____<br />Works great, fits perfectly in my RV. Would give 5/5 but the exhaust fan is a $3 computer fan sleeved bearing rather than ball bearing. Ideally a delta, sunon, \"Dust proof\" with sealed ball bearing package fan This would add at least $20 cost to the unit and is still not rated for moisture but It wouldn't get it inside its mechanism. This ones wide opened.<br /><br />This fan won't last, I expect it to be dead in a few months at the most.\n",

I spent two days looking for the problem. I finally reasoned the small motor in this ice maker is defective. I took a lamp cord and connected the two ends directly to the motor (dangerous I know but I had to do it) and the motor turned fine. I decided to put it all together and install the ice maker in the fridge. It started working and test showed it now had power. I let it cycle through and it made a batch of ice. I let it cycle a couple more times and dumped out the ice. Overnight working and it had a good amount of ice in the bucket. I left it to do its thing and it has no problems since. It makes better ice than the original ice maker. I'm still puzzled as to why boosting the motor fixed the problem. Perhaps there was bad or no contact in the circular switch that controls the ice maker until the motor turned a bit, I don't know. But what I do know is it works fine now.\n",

I tried to capture this in the photo (replacement is circled), but it is hard to see because it is 1. a slight difference and 2. hard to see because of the lighting. I could definitely tell the difference, however, when it was attached to the stove.<br /><br />I ordered similar knobs from 2 other companies trying to find a match. They are all silver, despite looking \"brushed\" in some photos.  I compared knobs from all 3 companies with the original and they are incredibly similar.<br /><br />In the end, I chose a different company’s knob because it was slightly easier to slide on and off of the stove for easier cleaning, but all the knobs I ordered are good quality and are acceptable replacements.

The only issue with this type of filter is you have to clean it often. I clean mine everyday, but your mileage may vary depending on how dusty your place is. If you do not clean this often enough, the dust will build up on the surface, restricting airflow. Still, highly recommended!<br /><br />Edit 9/22/2016: After using these for a few weeks now, I had to take away 1 star. The filter is a little too fine, and restricts airflow quite a bit. I did a few temp measurements with and without this filter and they actually restrict the airflow enough to raise the temps a few degrees. Mine went up about 6 degrees, which in my opinion is a little too much. I will probably be replacing these with less fine filters.\n",

It is adjustable if it wasn't to temperature. The delivery was on-time, but it was supposed to come with free installation and removing the old one. The delivery guys didn't even attempt it. They said they couldn't do the conversion to LP. They said they couldn't unhook the electrical and they could not unhook the gas line. And they definitely couldn't re-wire the stove back into the electrical box or re-hookup the LP gas line. In fact, they wanted to leave the old range where it sat and leave the new one in the living room. I said \"stand back\" while I grabbed a screwdriver and pipe wrench... while they watched.

            "Document Sentence: I'm fixing a Maytag Nautilus Dryer that had a broken motor Belt Pulley. The end of the original Belt Pulley just sheared off at the nut end and left the inward part of the belt pulley still attached to the motor shaft. It destroyed the Dryer belt in the process.<br />The part number on the old motor belt pulley says “751686”. You will not find this part number on the web.  I literally spent an entire evening trying to find info on it or what the replacement motor belt pulley part would be. Turns out no one knows, so I took a chance on this part since it had the same right hand thread pattern (right hand to install it) on the motor shaft and it looked similar. I ordered 2 since I was afraid I’d destroy the first one trying to install it.<br />Maytag will tell you that there is no replacement motor belt pulley and wants you to purchase a new motor ($130 - $203). I tried this $10 part instead and it worked fine. A little hard to tighten but went right on and works fine.<br />So here’s a little info on my issue. The Dryer is a Maytag Nautilus Model MDE5500AYW. I found out there are only 2 motors for the Nautilus Dryers: W10410997 which has a “D” shaped motor shaft to the front Blower wheel.  The other motor is WP33002795 and it has a threaded front motor shaft that connects to the Blower Wheel.  This is the motor I had. If you look at the ID tag on the motor you won’t find any of these part numbers though. My motor said it was Part Number “2201832”, Model S58NXMYG-7001. When you search 2201832 on the internet you’ll find it’s the same thing as the WP33002795 (which obviously is the Whirlpool Manufacture Part Number). Whirlpool makes Maytag.<br />Since both motors are threaded on the “back” end for the Motor Belt Pulley, to mount the belt pulley onto, I’m sure this particular Pulley will fit both motors. I have to warn you though that the other motor (with the D Shaped front motor shaft) does have its own Pulley that has a Cone Shape Rubber Boot next to the stubbier looking Belt Pulley (see W31001535 which may be that type replacement part).<br />This pulley here is known by many part numbers, but I’m going to just stick to the most popular numbers I know it as: WP8066184 or 8066184 (which was on the package the part came in as) and it should fit either motor. If you’re going to use this Pulley on the other D shaped motor then you’ll probably need to remove the rubber Cone Boot since this Pulley has the Cone shape already incorporated in its design.<br />To install this motor Belt Pulley you’ll need a 1” Wrench, or Socket setup. I used a Crescent Wrench and that wasn’t much fun because the threads were really binding up about 4 threads onto the motor shaft and my wrench kept trying to slip off. Just make sure you place the cone end of the pulley towards the motor housing and start it by hand so you know the threads are lined up. If you don’t hand start it onto the treads you’ll probably cross thread the pulley and need the second pulley that came in this package. Keep tightening the pulley until it’s almost touching the motor bearing/Housing. Don’t let the cone touch the Bearing/Housing because you’ll rub against the parts and overheat it. Not good. Turn the motor shaft a couple times to make sure the pulley isn’t warped from installing it. The motor shaft should almost be flush to the belt pulley center when you’re done.  Now install the Dryer Drum, Idler Pulley and Drum Belt to test the dryer rotation. Put everything back together (there are several Parts Repair Company’s out there that have excellent Videos if you get stuck). Turn the Dryer on for a couple minutes and listen for any squealing and make sure the Dryer heats up. Now you’re ready to do a load.\n",

            "Document Sentence: The microwave oven stopped heating. In my case, the failed magnetron was the problem. Not a simple task to replace the magnetron in this 12 year old GE Spacesaver microwave oven, but not overly complicated either if you have that skill set. Of course the microwave oven must be taken down from above the stove to start this repair, which is a two-person effort. But once removed and installed on a secure work table, it took about 60 minutes to carefully disassemble the case and remove the failed magnetron. Lots of screws need to be removed to remove the microwave case to get to the magnetron, so take care to keep track of where each needs to go back when it is time to reinstall the case.  Removing the failed magnetron was simple, disconnecting the wiring and removing the mounting nuts. The re-installation of the new magnetron went well as it was a exact replacement, however on this oven, fitting the magnetron back into the plastic cooling ducts for the magnetron took a bit of extra effort, but not a show stopper.  This magnetron comes with a separate diode that should be replaced at the same time as the magnetron is replaced. Simple to replace the diode on the high voltage capacitor, but requires care if the capacitor has not been discharged. As a caution, if you are not somewhat familiar with electronics and don't consider yourself a competent handyperson, don't attempt this repair without the assistance of a person with the proper skill level. This is not a trivial task. But once the magnetron was replaced and the microwave reassembled, it heated perfectly and was ready to go back in service at a total cost of a third or less of the cost of a new microwave of similar capacity and features.\n",

Why? Sucks!<br /> bad odor smell when oven is turned on for the first couple of times (it will dissipate over time) I was told but I e had it for two weeks now and will have it looked at if it don’t go away, if you have a family of 4 this appliance is not for you it’s too small, you can’t really multitask for a large family with this range, large oversize pots won’t fit close together because it’s a small size range,  you can’t easily find pre-fitted plastic plates for burners for easy cleanup.<br /><br /> The pictures I am displaying are obviously real and my range looks a bit dirty because it has been used, as much as I love cooking I enjoy entertaining.<br />I don’t know about the negative review that was published, but I will update everyone after a year of owning this beautiful gas range.

The opening that is supposed to slide into the sink is minuscule, I cannot imagine what sink tap that is supposed to fit since mine are standard builder-grade in my apartment, so we need to buy an adapter. Fine, so we filled it manually with a bucket of water for now. Second problem, the manual indicated that there are fill lines for the water on the washer side, there arent. Again, fine, I looked on youtube found a few references for this brand and and filled a bit more than halfway which seemed to work fine.  First wash cycle is going well, I start the drain hose and immediately notice there’s a hole right next to be base of the washer where the hose extends out of. Whether this was a manufacturing or shipping issue, no clue but because of the hole placement, water got all over the floors, I would try to put it in my shower but of course the power cord is about 2 feet long and does not reach. So disappointed that these little things have ruined this purchase.

            "Document Sentence: [[VIDEOID:561fab8e9ff44c34e9ce356ee682c86c]] I am very disappointed by the quality control and the customer service. I received the range hood and the cooktop. The packages looked good, didn't see any damage. Then I tried to install them right away. Installation is not hard as long as you have all tools needed. To my surprise, the range hood has one side dented. Since the package is totally fine, I don't think it could be done during shipping. Probably it was during manufacturing or packaging. Since I am already half way installed. So I decided to ignore it since it's not that obvious anyway. After I had the range hood installed. When I clean the wrap, there is one more surprise. There is a screw and a nut in the wrap. Since I already had the heavy range hood installed. I don't really know where did they come from. Maybe they got loose from the range hood. Or maybe they were simply wrapped together during packaging. Either way, I don't think the quality control could allow this for products sold for such high price. And then when I tried to use the cooktop, the right rear burner could not stay on. After ignited, it will turn off after about 10 sec with a click sound inside the cooktop. I think that's some sort of safety feature kicking in to shut off the gas because some defect part could not detect the burning temperature. So the cooktop thinks the fire was not ignited. Then shutoff the gas supply automatically. I tried to press down the knob to force ignition for 30 sec or longer. Sometimes, the burner could stay on. But most of the time, it will turn off again some time later. I've contacted the seller on Jan 9th. And I was told that Fotile service department will contact me. A week has passed. I didn't hear from them at all. All in all, I am really disappointed. I encountered issues with both Fotile products, that's not something could simply be explained by the \"bad luck\".\n",

I couldn't wait to get it installedand was able to install it myself. I turned the breaker back on and tested it out.  First, I started with steam from boiling water...no dice.  Then I took a rolled up piece of paper and set it on fire for a slow burn that generated a large quantity of smoke...the dual fans at full 720cfm only swirled the smoke under the hood itself.  Then, tried frying some beef scraps for my dog...this set off the smoke alarm in my dining room and filled the house with the smell of fried meat scraps.<br /><br />A $630.00 waste of money.  The $125.00 range hood it replaced did a much better job.  Live and learn.  I will never buy another Kobe product again.\n",

R600a or Isopentane has less global warming potential if a leak occurs.<br /><br />Regarding the fridge itself, its cute! It has a cute retro look and rounded design. Glass shelves which is nice, rather than the ugly wire shelves seen in some. Its also very quite. I cannot hear it running from once I am more than a few feet away from it.<br /><br />Using it in my office and it has been great, biggest advantage to this unit is the designated freezer section. It actually freezes food, unlike those small internal freezer sections in some smaller mini refrigerators.<br /><br />One strange observation: the logo of the brand was applied over the plastic protective film on the front metal of the doors. When I removed the film, I removed the Demuller logo. Does not matter to me, but an interesting observation.\n",

Instead of a basket to dump stuff in, there are 2 pull out compartments and a roomy shelf.  And you can pull them out to temporarily store oversized.  Yeah, it seems weird that the coils are open, as others have pointed out.  But it works very well.  The refrigerator door shelves are adjustable too.  What else could you ask for?  An egg holder for 12 instead of 10?  Who cares - it's European, and if it's irritating just toss it.  Egg cartons fit well on the door shelves.  And the trucking company that EvVive used was great.

            "Document Sentence: We bought this to sit on our bar in our home to dispense ice whenever we wanted it instead of running back and forth to the kitchen for ice. There are several problems: 1) extremely noisy - the thing sounds like some one is building a Buick literally continuously. 2) the cubes are only barely frozen and melt VERY rapidly (although they are adorably small and cute) 3) the machine is not made to sit there continuously making and dispensing ice. We did not realize till we set it up (and threw away the boxes and packaging - shame on us) that it's meant to make ice and then be shut off. At the back of the instruction manual it says you shouldn't let it sit there turned on with ice in it and that it's meant to make some ice and then be shut off. This makes no sense whatsoever. If it's just going to make some ice that you then have to store in the freezer, then why wouldn't you just buy a bag of ice for $2 and store THAT in the freezer? We bought this so we had an ice maker in our bar area so we could get ice anytime we wanted, all the time. This is the dumbest product ever. I wouldn't mind so much if it was $10 but it was expensive and really a stupid design for a tabletop icemaker.\n",

No proactive communication, no re-active communication and then when it did finally show up (over a week later), there was no notification whatsoever. And the \"free\" icemaker gift that was supposed to be included? NOPE! And to add insult to injury, I sent a message to the seller letting them know that it was not included. Their response? \"I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about\". I wasn't vague nor indirect. Pretty clear in my message. Anyway, that's all I got. If you need a freezer immediately in today's supply-chain challenged market and don't mind paying \"pandemic rates\", then this freezer will work.

Ordered it after reading the reviews, I almost bought new stove - cheapest in class would be almost 900$, and not even close with Frigidaire quality. Also I have to change the blowing motor under the glass cook top, it will prevent electronics from overheating. It died a few months ago, also I use the high temperature silicon and new screws to prevent motor from making noise. Now I need black silicon to seal the top gasket from leaking grease onto the board. Hope it will last me another 3-5 years.

Looking for longevity.<br /><br />The new OEM roller is on the right (in pic.) I really liked that the triangle plastic clips from original design have been done away with. I did save the old ones in case I go back to the old design. If you notice, the new OEM spindle is much smaller than the original- take care when tightening. I used a quarter inch socket to tighten (close enough.)  I used a 9/16 wrench to hold the nut from the back (closest to 14 mm.) I only replaced the rear rollers due to cost. I'm also wondering about the thinness of the steel clip that is used to replace the plastic clips (see second pic.)  However everything assembled well and is working quietly and without issue. I did notice these rollers do spin more freely than the knockoffs. I will apprise if things go awry.\n",

            "Document Sentence: I have a GE French door type refrigerator that quit cooling.  The compressor was working so I figured the evaporator fan was bad.  Removed the shelves and drawers and then took off the rear plastic cover that covered the fan.  Was very easy to remove the fan and the blades would not spin easy which means the bearing went bad.  Installed a new fan and refrigerator section started cooling.  Less than 30 minutes to swap fans out and all you need is simple tools.<br /><br />As a followup, my lower freezer section was cold but it was taking time to freeze things.  I removed freezer drawers and checked the fan in the back, it was not running!  I ordered new freezer fan ( different fan that what refrigerator section uses) and new one runs fine and freezer is working much better!  Only tool needed was a flat screwdriver to pry the fan cover off.<br /><br />So, my advice is if your refrigerator uses two evaporator fans replace both at the same time !\n",

            "Document Sentence: It took a while for the contractor to install it in my new kitchen since I had it vented to the outside. I think it was worth it. t works very well in getting the smells out of my kitchen. I wanted something that was not too loud and removed smells since my kitchen remodel included removing most of the wall between the kitchen and dining room which opened the kitchen (and smells) up to the rest of the house. I give it four stars because it came with the cover off one of the lights. Amazon shipped me a whole new hood so I could replace the one light. Then, I used it once and one of the lights stopped working. Haven't replaced the light yet. I wrote to the manufacturer and they were looking into it but it's been a month and I haven't received an update...or a new light fixture. One other complaint I have is that the cover over the filters slips out of place easily when I open it up to clean the filters. I have to be careful it doesn't fall onto my glass-top stove. At first I thought the contractor had done something wrong in the install but after looking at it, I don't know how else he could have attached it so it must be a design issue. It's not a show-stopper, just annoying.\n",
            "Document Sentence: Ordered a cook top from this seller. The delivery time frame and transaction where as expected. The cooktop arrived, when the unit was inspected prior to install the unit had parts falling out of it from inside the unit. Contacted the seller, who stated that they would contact the manufacturer. The unit looked ok, however we did not know if the parts where extra that where not caught in the manufacturing process or if they came from that unit. There was no way to tell if the unit was in working order until install. When the install was complete the unit had a burner that had become dislodged and shifted from where it should be. Contacted the seller who stated that someone was needed to come out and inspect the unit prior to them doing anything, which was a week ago. So at this point I paid for a new working unit, I have received a unit with parts falling out that does not work, with a seller unwilling to make it right.

When the middle (largest) burner is turned on, the igniter thinks it isn't, so it keeps clicking and trying to ignite the already lit burner. It stops after a few minutes when it has heated up, but it's loud and annoying and persistent for the first couple of minutes. I contacted their customer support and they said, basically, \"sorry, that's normal, just deal with it.\" Not sure what world they live in where that's normal... So frustrating.<br />It was also a little smaller than my previous<br />30\" stove, so we had to do some minor construction to make the countertop fit the stove, but that's kinda our fault for not checking the dimensions carefully before we purchased it, but just be aware of that.

I tested all the internal components with a multimeter and everything was fine, but my dryer was not getting as hot.  After some research it turns out that this component can basically cause problems everywhere.  Once I replaced it, everything started working as normal, better in fact then it had before, though that’s probably due to cleaning it out thoroughly.  My guess is one of the circuits to the heater blew.  If you know everything else is good.  Try this one.  Also LG Dryers suck, they are not durable and parts tend to be harder to find (more expensive).  You are better off with something simpler like a Maytag.  Most of the extra features don’t even work that well.  Do not even get me started about the lint try, which can easily catch on clothes and destroy them.\n",

Box all messed up and I still gave it the benefit of the doubt only to open it and my bby is beat bent and bruised. My first thought was I should’ve sent it back the instant I noticed rips on my box period(when UPS was at my door). I work hard like others doing heavy lifting so I try to be mindful and considerate of that with others but no never again do I want anything looking like this. Long story short they come the next day to pick it back up and I was told I would do a return and replacement, only for me to find out the day after they picked it up, it will only be a return and a refund smfh!!! It’s like what no one is understanding right now especially Amazon/customer service is it’s not about the money I really need my portable washer in brand new condition travelers experience to its new home with me and that it not a washer I’m instantly feeling has been through a lot. Now I don’t know what UPS did but someone needs to be held accountable for that machine being sent to me like that. Like seriously what has the world come to that a person even have go through buying something so serious and it’s not handled as such. If people don’t want to do delivery or just can’t please stop cause most people that order things to be delivered need there things in tac. I’m sooooooooo super pissed 😤 cause now I have to wait on the whole process over again and just everything because I literally just want this one 😩 I ain’t gone lie after this one I’m taking a nice lil break from Amazon online shopping.

The texture of the silicone is smooth but it stays in place well; it's flexible enough to adjust to minor spacing issues.  Here's the biggest consideration:  on my gas stove the grills for the burners extend to the very edge of the stove, and thus touch the silicone strip slightly, and after two weeks the strip is starting to show wear from the heat.  It seems the product would resist heat that radiates through the air or through the metal of the stove's outer shell, but it clearly does not resist heat that radiates through the grill that sits above a gas burner.\n",

            "Document Sentence: Great for apartments, I have a family of six. We just used it for the first time as a large load. It worked great! The wash cycle is perfect for separated garments.<br /><br />Recommendation for this product:<br />Pros:<br />1) cleans well.<br />2)Use smaller loads. And will clean two pairs of adult jeans on wash side, and spin dry one pair at a time on the spin dry side.<br />3) it is small to a point and light to carry or lift when empty.<br />4) Great for apartment use, and no bigger than six people per washer! If you have more than six people per week that you have to wash for I would recommend getting two of these.<br />5) works great if placed in the bathroom shower tub; make sure that you use proper electrical safety guidelines. Also maybe you should use a showerhead that is extended, or the inlet tube.<br />6) for a family of six; I spent 3 1/2 hours washing and spin drying six people‘s clothes. About 15 to 20 minutes on wash, and 5 to 10 minutes depending on items placed in spin dryer for each load.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) The cord of this item is very short you will need an extension cord. Remember to use proper safety electrical guidelines if you place it anywhere near a tub or water source.<br />2) if the spin dryer is alone while working, it will shake the entire product. And could damage the machine if not properly secured.<br />3) The drain hose is very short, if you do not have your product elevated on a stand and secured above the drain area, the pump will only get 95% of the water out and leave some in the hose which can cause mold or mildew to fester if left undrained.<br />4) this may or may not be a con however, the inlet hose that it comes with does not secure very well to the Fossett or showerhead connection, so be aware of this.<br />5) The noise level is fine, however it would be nice if the machine came with a buzzer or a bell to tell you when it is finished. So you have to be listening for the machine to stop, or be watching it or set a timer for yourself. Or you will forget about it.<br /><br />All in all, this product is extremely worth the money that I spent. I will recommend this product to everyone I know. After all, you’re already paying for water, so why not use it.\n",

Size of this unit's parts that are critical for a proper fit are nearly a perfect match to an actual Maytag brand PUR filter  UKF7003. Only a few of the locking features are a tiny bit smaller.  I did these measurements with a machinist's caliper. This item fit perfectly and easily into my Jenn-Air Fridge.  It did not leak.  The water it provided was perfectly clear and tasted great. I look forward to the more effective filtration that will be likely be available, because of their better than usual carbon block.  Fortunately I ordered this brand in addition to another, and that other brand from Aquaquest said it would substitute for UKF7003 BUT it would not have fit considering how much bigger its key parts are.  I am returning that other brand.\n",

Quite possibly the worst instruction manual I've ever seen.  Not enough detail and pictures were very blurry / grainy; very little help.  After running out and picking up the keg and getting the CO2 cartridge filled, noticed about a 2 inch hairline crack on the inside, bottom left floor.  I put some duct tape over it as I had already thrown out the box and brought the keg home.  Temp has only dropped to about 37 degrees, so beer is pretty warm and mostly foam.

            "Document Sentence: Our range hood fan had been damaged by careless roofers years ago - they took off the roof jack and didn't put anything to protect from debris falling down the exhaust duct. That resulted in the original fan's squirrel cage getting bent and contacting the housing. This unit was a good replacement, there are only two complaints I have - the vendor I bought the part from salvages good parts out of damaged units (making the price very attractive) and when they removed this one, it looks like they broke one of the tabs that retains the motors power connector into the hood. There was still a good one, so no big deal and given the hidden location, I would have been fine zip tying it in place to hold it together. The other complaint is that the mounting flange was different from the original. Wasn't a big deal, though we already had the motor in place hanging by the shoulder screws and didn't want to take it back down, so we just had to drill a couple of pilot holes to be able to secure it with the sheet metal screws. If we had noticed this difference ahead of time, we may have been able to swap the mating flange from the original assembly.<br /><br />Overall, this product works great, and it's nice to have a functioning hood fan again. Just wanted to put these notes down so someone else may be able to benefit in the future. Also worth noting, the cheapest I could find this replacement was $100 more than buying this &#34;salvaged&#34; new part. Well worth the couple of issues we ran into.\n",

            "Document Sentence: Update, over 1 year after purchase: I just don't even like these things now. Frost on all the shelves of both freezers. Door on the problem unit is hot to the touch, no reply to original review from the seller. Appears the “high quality seal” wasn't even touching the body of the unit in some places. A third of the interior ultimately became one solid ice block as we were unable to do the manual defrost sooner. Threw away an entire trash bag full of food. Cannot find a manual to identify how to get a replacement seal or otherwise troubleshoot.<br /><br />2-3 months after purchase:<br /><br />I was searching for upright freezers to fit specific dimensions with a plain black front, preferably no LED display on the front (to fit and visually disappear into my antique cabinet) and settled on 2 of these! I was very excited as they fit and look perfect for what I needed. I used to have a chest freezer, but having an upright so that you can easily see what is stored within IS so much better than a deep freezer where things get lost at the bottom. And I loved them at first but…<br /><br />-they are so noisy, which makes my search (and extra money paid) for a nice quiet refrigerator, which is to the left of the cabinet, pointless.<br />-not to mention these freezers are only about 2-3 months old and look at these ice dams!! They are closed/sealed tightly every time, so this is unacceptable to me! My old igloo deep freezer was $100 secondhand and still never did this after 4 years of use. VERY DISAPPOINTED at this.<br />-i don’t like the sloppy edges where you can see the insulation and whatnot, but i didn’t mind it when i unwrapped the freezers, bc they were otherwise (visually) perfect. Sharing since i know it’ll be a real issue for some.<br />-i THINK i can reverse the door swing on the left freezer and may do that later since I’ll have to remove it from the cabinet to manually defrost anyway.<br /><br />***keep in mind that i intentionally placed this in my home where the freezers never receive direct sunlight, because i was concerned about energy consumption and longevity. So there’s no good reason for them to be so noisy and building up ice dams like this.<br /><br />I’m just a few months into having these, and I’m  just very let down.\n",

It isn't the machine itself as the original valve for hot water worked fine and just a matter that the cold would not fully stop filling the tub.  It worked properly for shutting off the cold as the diagnostic identified it would fix the problem.  All the hookups (electrical) fit fine.  It is relatively easy to install.  By the way, using the chat with seller feature didn't work either.  Totally disappointed.  The compatibility for the model matched on the list of compatible machines, it looks slightly different than the original so it isn't OEM.  FYI if this happens to you an option for work around is to buy a hose hook up splitter and attach to the cold, a splitter will allow you to run the machine on cold setting for all and use the valves on the splitter to turn off the hot side for a cold load, open both for warm or turn off the cold hose for a hot load (note the hot load will then rinse with hot as well and warm will rinse with warm opposed to a cold rinse only but a small inexpensive fix to work around until I can find a new one that will actually work. see image of hose splitter attached\n",

            "Document Sentence: I was quite nervous about ordering this, a relatively new/unknown brand of rangetop , from an unknown seller (SDADI, Inc.).  I'm pleased to say that everything could not have been better. We were contacted very quickly after ordering to arrange a delivery time/day, and given full contact info for the shipping company. On arrival day (only a week later!) the shipper called to say he was a few hours away on his route and then again 15 minutes before he arrived. The rangetop itself was very sturdily packaged on its own pallet and arrived without a single scratch.  Installation was fast and went without a hitch. The rangetop itself has exceeded our expectations. Flame control is precise - from very low to blazing, and it is a well built and sturdy appliance. Cleanup has been easy as well, although be advised that the grates are very heavy!  One feature I did not know of prior to ordering is that the back left burner can be adjusted to use as a low simmer/keep warm burner.  One thing to note - the center grate is very slightly higher than the side grates. We are hoping to level them out by adding small silicone pads under the other two grates.  Overall one of my best Amazon purchases!\n",

Though, you could probably get creative with this.<br /><br />Overall quality of product seems durable, pleasant design and color.<br /><br />Comes with water pitcher, fruit basket, dishes rack with utensils and cup rack, water hose, drain hose, and very clear and easy to understand instructions.<br /><br />Customer service is Top Quality, Quick to respond, fair and reasonable. Their repair and refund policy is above and beyond expectations.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />No top rack option, but to be fair it would need to be a bit taller for that.<br /><br />The light doesn't have an on/off option. Which is nice to have since you could watch it and be sure it's functioning properly.<br /><br />Doesn't have a way to adjust the temperature for the cycles.<br /><br />Doesn't have enough water power when washing heavily soiled dishes. But perhaps with a different detergents this would help.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with the ease of use and manual water filling option. While I did have some issues with the digital display and the upper washing arm, on my first unit, the company resolved this by sending me a whole new unit at no cost to me. When I called the company and explained the situation, they decided to replace the entire unit immediately and did not require me to send the original one back. All they asked was I send them a video of the unit and tried troubleshooting it with me first to no avail.<br /><br />While the original unit does work, I have to open the door and manually spin the arm several times to get it going, and the timer display doesn't show the numbers of how much time is left properly. The company did send me a replacement. I expect it will work properly and look forward to using it.<br /><br />I am pleased with the unit and would recommend this company and this product to others.\n",

            "Document Sentence: The first hint was the box the vent came in was torn, clearly had been opened before. We were (and are still) in the midst of a kitchen remodel with time lines to meet with various contractors, so we couldn't take the time to return it and get a replacement. The instructions are TERRIBLE! All the parts were there when the box was unpacked so we went ahead with the installation. Poor quality, flimsy craftsmanship, both panels split at the seams before they were even put in place (see picture) but due to our contractor's timeline, we had it installed and the seams had to be tig welded for it to be functional and presentable. When we took the white protective film off (which is very difficult and time consuming), we noticed a small ding in the front  of the hood right at the seam above the buttons that turn on the fan/lights which was not really noticeable when the white film was on it. This hood was installed ONLY because the electrical contractor is booked solid until October, but we will be replacing the hood in October, we are already booked with our contractor to do so; he, too, has never run across a hood so poorly manufactured. VERY BAD PRODUCT- DO NOT BUY THIS HOOD. I am also VERY disappointed in Amazon for their lack of vetting sellers/distributors. I've seen a steep decline in quality of merchandise in recent months so Amazon is becoming less and less trustworthy in my eyes and no longer my \"go to\" place. I'm disappointed in myself for putting ease of purchasing via Amazon before quality- never again.\n",

I had to file it to get it on the shaft at all - and tried tapping it with  it with a rubber mallet - the plastic just broke with the mildest tap. I really needed to get the washing machine back going so carefully filed the metal insert of the next one until it was close - then fabricated a tool I could use to press it onto the shaft without touching the plastic.

Still groaning.  We have kids and do a lot of laundry.  This washer actually makes life harder.  we have to rewash loads, and cut them down smaller constantly.  Yesterday we washed a medium size load with a pair of my kids(5 year old...small socks) sandy socks on top.  They were still sitting on top and still sandy...but wet after the load completed.  Do yourself a favor and keep looking.  This isn't the washer you are looking for.  we have had it for 8 months and after trial and error, several service calls we are done.  Called amazon and of course there is \"nothing they can do for us\"  besides sending out the tech to trouble shoot the problem again.\n",

The replacement was basic plug and play.  My old one didn't have a ground wire, so I just removed it from the new part..... low and behold, it worked perfectly!  Compressor came on immediately, and it's been working great for almost six months now.

I have done a lot of shopping around for the perfect one and I found the more expensive ones didn’t meet people’s expectations. So I decided to give this guy a try; I bought the larger size and stronger recommend spending the little extra for the space. This unit is the perfect size, it has a much larger inside then it seems in the videos and photos. In this video there is only one single normal size shower towel, and a small tank top and has room for a few more items. My cloths came out very clean, which was a concern of mine as well but I threw a laundry safe bleach tablet and laundry soap in and my cloths smelled SO fresh. If you utilize all the space in the washer available you will need to do two separate spin cycles, however they are only five minutes long and the wash is 15. The cloths will not come out completely dry, but they are just a tiny bit damp it drys so well! That being said you  will need a dryer rack/string to hang your cloths on to get completely dry cloths. The cloths do not come out feeling crunchy like a soaking wet towel dried in the sun though, they feel pretty darn soft! Obviously not as soft as a heated dryer but very manageable for a daily wear. My only complaint is the hoses, I’d love them to be just a little bit longer and thicker. But both were long enough. I seriously spent months adding a ton of different brands and styles to my Amazon cart and removing them with fear they would waste money. But I can assure you I wish I had bought this sooner. It has immensely improved the quality of my life already.\n",

Rubber feet are installed for table top, or used with propane while camping. Different nozzles and tools included with kit if using propane instead of NG. I installed in a recessed kitchen cut out. There are no 90° clips with unit to secure it tight under the counter, weight of unit seems sufficient to keep it in place as long as counter cuts are snug..! Wanted to remove the rubber feet but the nuts on the inside of the stove were not tack welded and can become loose inside the unit & non retrievable.. Not the end of the world. One loose nut in bottom of unit after I removed 1 rubber foot. 1 burner a little off ‘kilter’ yet overall I am definitely satisfied for the price.

If you were imagining a futuristic-style gadget like it's described as... well, keep imagining.<br /><br />EDIT: I'd like to humbly change my review to 3 stars. Although it's definitely not for everyone and their aims, it is a significant comfort go-to for me. I suffer from terminal cancer, and am bedridden at age 46. So there's always a drink in this cooler. And waking at all times of the hours, I usually have a cooler beverage to drink on.<br /><br />And that's a huge positive comment on the item's longevity. I always keep it plugged in and running for what has been months now. I think it may occasionally turn off possibly when the fan overheats, but this is rare. It's also taken a few accidental knocks onto the floor and hasn't missed a beat.<br /><br />Still, it is not for everyone's needs. But if you know someone in a similar position such as I, they might appreciate this on their bedside table.\n",

Unfortunately the hose that it came with was not for a standard sink. I had gone to a few local big box stores to see if I could find something to work, to no avail.<br /><br />I eventually decided to see what I could do to make it work, by purchasing some fittings to make it attach. Ultimately it worked out, but I had to wait until today to put it all together. The parts I ordered are listed below.<br /><br />Now for the machine itself, it runs well after all of that.

Then sometimes the fan would quit entirely and the compressor would run constantly trying to keep things cold, but only the freezer would be cold because the fan wasn't blowing the cold air down to the refrigerator.  I had a digital thermometer in both parts and it could not maintain the temp.<br /><br />The great thing about these cheap medium sized Maytag refrigerators is there are very few parts to fail. I suspected the fan was bad so I took it out. It is very easy, just remove the screws in the back panel of the freezer and pull the temp knob off, then grab the panel using the vents and pull!  I took out the fan motor and the shaft was wobbly. I got the part number and ordered this replacement.  This is an exact match and fit for the original. Took me about 10 minutes to put it back in place and the fridge has worked PERFECTLY since.  It is quiet now and has maintained 40 F in the fridge and 0 F in the freezer for a month now.

            "Document Sentence: First, I was very apprehensive about buying a dishwasher on-line. But, after shopping around at every store in ouir area, we learned the earliest possible delivery date for this machine is MAYBE August! When we found it on Amazon, we decided to take a chance.<br />We love the machine. It is whisper quiet and cleans 10 times better than our old machine. I had to do a 'test' on the first load. We made Baked Mac and Cheese, I scraped out the heavy chunks but didn't rinse at all. The pan came out spotless. With the old washer the pan would have come out as dirty as it went in.<br />As for the condition it came in, there was a huge dent in the door (see pictures). No sign of damage on the box it came in or I would have opened it and inspected before signing for delivery. I contacted the seller and they were very responsive and took immediate ownership of the problem. They offered to let me return it, but since it is impossible to replace right now, I declined. Instead they offered to replace the dented panel at no charge, as long as I was OK with it. That was a fine solution. Unfortunately, a few days later, the new panel came dented also. A much smaller dent but still dented. I contacted the seller and again they were apologetic and took ownership. We came to an agreement and in the end, I am satisfied with the dishwasher AND the seller. I would certainly buy from them again. They have great customer service. And, I don't blame them for the dent. Since the box it came in didn't show signs of damage, I believe it was shipped from Bosch that way. Same with the replacement pane.\n",

            "Document Sentence: The quality and construction  of this range hood seems good. However, there are a few things that give me pause.<br /><br />First, the name &#34;Eureka&#34; seems to be a borrowed name or something. There is nothing on the hood itself, or in the literature/pamphlet that were supplied with this hood that actually says &#34;Eureka&#34;. If you open it up and look inside, the only name on anything at all is the blower motor that says &#34;Shengzhau Hailiang Electrical Appliances CO, LTD&#34;. The model number on the sticker is completely blank (there's a spot on the sticker for a model number, but nothing is written on it).<br /><br />The literature included with the unit is quite clear and understandable considering that it's a Chinese import. None of the usual fractured English that we've all become used to. On the last page is three paragraphs about &#34;Contact Us&#34;. They inform you to email or call, but there is not one single email address or phone number. Good luck with that.<br /><br />For the record, the hood came from Sunflower Trading Company 10800 Bellaire Blvd Ste C, Houston, Texas 77072. They have no web presence that I could find, but their phone number is: (281) 530-1511. I could find no email address or anything else about them other than a couple of business listings.<br /><br />The hood is described as having halogen lights, and the literature says they have three settings (off, high, & low). However, ours came with LED lights (I consider that a good thing), but they only have one intensity (I consider that a bad thing). Our old NuTone hood came with halogen lights that we swapped for some energy efficient LEDs. The swap was easy-peasy, andthe NuTone had a switch that went from, off, to low, medium, and high intensities. It appears that if you need to change the LEDs on this unit, you will have to partially disassemble the unit. I guess we will cross that bridge when we come to it.<br /><br />The unit is described as &#34;quiet&#34;. Not for me. Our old NuTone was much, much quieter on the low setting than this unit is. We even increased the size of the vent from 6&#34; to 7&#34; to try to reduce the velocity of the air. No joy in Mudville. It's not terrible, but I would not describe it as quiet.<br /><br />The fan control is goofy. You &#34;enable&#34; the fans by pushing the power button. This causes all the speed lights (Q, 2, 3, & 4) to begin blinking. If you then push one of those lights, it will proceed at that speed (I guess if you don't push one of the speed buttons, the unit will deactivate itself at some point, but I haven't tested that). To turn off the fans, you push the power button again. This doesn't actually turn off the fan, it starts a 3 minute timer to shut off in 3 minutes, and starts blinking the light associated with the speed the fan is running. If you press the power button a second time, it will actually turn off.<br /><br />Finally, all the buttons trigger a very annoying &#34;BEEP&#34; whenever you push any of the buttons, or when power is turned on. There is no easy way to turn this &#34;feature&#34; off. VERY irritating! I opened up the unit (16 screws) to gain access to the circuit board. The beeper (labeled &#34;buzzer&#34; on the CB) is soldered in place, so you can't just unplug it. Luckily, there are two traces that connect to the beeper; cutting the trace on either one will kill the beeper (we cut one of them). The buttons themselves have a very positive &#34;click&#34; sound when you press any of them, so for us, that is all we need to know that we've actually pushed some kind of button.<br /><br />Lastly, we're not exactly dissatisfied with this hood. It's handsome, and was easy to install. It works, but is not as quiet as we were lead to believe. i may try adding some sound dampening to he chimney, but I do not expect to get much sound reduction. When this thing is on high, it is a jet aircraft.<br />If anything ever goes wrong with it, I expect that we will end up pitching it, because there doesn't appear to be a &#34;there&#34; there.<br /><br />Good luck to the next buyer.\n",

I tried to message the seller to clear up the water pump issue and that it's not automatic like it says in the title and description (which was my whole reason for going with this one in the first place) and there was no response.\n",

However, upon unpacking the hood, I discovered that the fan assembly module had apparently been installed incorrectly at the factory causing it to break loose from its mounting screws, damaging the back of the filters and dislodging one of the lights. Rather than sending this second hood back, I elected to repair the damaged fan assembly mountings so that I could install it in the hood case - using new screws - but requested that Windster and/or Amazon make some adjustment in the purchase price - both refused to do so.

Despite its relatively low price and the inclusion of some additional accessories, it has some significant drawbacks.<br />Firstly, the pizza oven lacks a lid, resulting in significant heat loss and fuel wastage. I have to spend more time and fuel to preheat the oven.<br />Secondly, the size of this pizza oven is relatively small, often causing my pizzas to touch the ceiling of the oven and become dirty. It has caused me a lot of trouble, as I have to carefully position the pizza every time to avoid contact with the oven.<br />In conclusion, this outdoor gas pizza oven has left me greatly disappointed.\n",

But the screw did attach through the thin cardboard packaging it came in; so unless the lid you want to mount this on is paper thin, I'd avoid it.<br /><br />Also, the materials this is made out of were very disappointing and low quality. The picture makes it looks like nice solid stainless steel and rubber-like grippy plastic, but the actual product was foil-thin metal and very cheap simi-gloss slippery plastic. For what you get with these, they really seem way over-priced.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother going to a hardware store to hunt down the right screws for these knobs after I paid so much for such low-quality cheap product. I'm returning them and trying something else.\n",

It's about the same dimensions as your everyday refrigerator.  Put it's a chore to move it without a dolly.  This dolly didn't solve the problem and is now a worthless piece of junk.\n",

As a result, there is no way to get both ends inserted into their respective female slots on the dryer .  I had to straighten the end opposite the electrical connection end then rebend it, closer to the end of the sensor, such that both ends can slip into their respective slots.  Once I did that and got the sensors installed, I come to learn that the end what connects to the eltricl connector is not eide enough, such that the electrical connector would simply slip off.  I had to cut the connectors off and install new clips that grabbed the tab of the sensor fitting more snugly.  Go to the OEM if you need this part is my advice\n",

            "Document Sentence: I have a vintage double General Electric oven that is original to my 1966 home. The oven still had an original element made in the USA by G.E. that finally melted/broke in one corner and needed replacement. Years ago I had borrowed it from the lower oven as a replacement for the top oven and haven't had a lower operating oven in years. So, I took the model number off the worn-out original heating element and found the correct replacement on-line. I had ordered a replacement from another Amazon seller (different brand) but after 5 days of waiting it still had not shipped. So I cancelled that order and chose 2 replacement elements from THINK FAST to put both upper/lower ovens back into like-new service. THINK FAST shipped the order quickly (I chose free shipping for my order over $35).<br /><br />While the oven was out-of-commission, I took the time to give the ovens a thorough cleaning from top to bottom with EASY OFF oven cleaner and rinsed off the chemical several times and waited delivery of the replacements.<br /><br />The elements arrived quickly (5 days) and in great shape. Each was heavily wrapped several times in small bubble wrap. Installation was a breeze with 4 screws (2 to connect the wire leads to the oven's flexible wire leads, and 2 to attach the rectangular mounting bracket to the oven's interior wall). I used the old screws since they were hex head and are easier to put in with the appropriate hex screw driver. (BTW, the element came with 2 Phillips head screws which I did not use.)<br /><br />After installation the ovens fired up perfectly. I am very happy with the product. The Exact Replacements heated efficiently like the original element. These old G.E. ovens are built like a tank. Rather than spend $2,000-3,000 for a top-of-the-line new fancy-state-of-the-art double oven, I spent less than $40 for TWO elements to keep my vintage oven working perfectly for many more years. I'm smiling today! ☺\n",

However, since my Fridgaire stove & oven is older & came with our house at purchase, we replaced the former handle with this new one anyway.  I am content at this point with it.  One concern is that these recommended screws were a \"tad\" too long but still provided a stable installation.  We removed the spacer that came with the screws.  It's been 2 weeks & I have baked twice with the new replacement.  It worked well. Further, I did not want any further delays to installing a new replacement.\n",

When it initially arrived, it had been dropped in shipping and the top front panel was smashed.  I contacted GASLAND Chef customer service and explained circumstances.  After a few emails and pictures, they sent a replacement and it arrived beautiful and intact.  And the stars are for the customer service as well! We installed it in a few hours (the electric wires that came with were not long enough for our space so it took a bit longer than normal). We have only used a few times, but works great so far!  The manual that comes with is a little lacking in some information but we will figure it out. The cooking modes are also a little confusing but will also figure it out over time.  Overall, this little oven looks great and very modern.\n",

            "Document Sentence: Excellent hood - it is beautiful.  Copper Tailor contacted me after the order and confirmed dimensions with CAD drawings.  We chose to extend the height of the hood and paid the difference and we are glad we did.  It is massive, heavy and great internals (fan, grates, lighting controls and fan speed controls - even came with a spare control module).<br /><br />Buyers must understand - this is fabricated in China and is good work - language barrier can cause some misunderstanding but rest assured they will follow through - as example when I asked if the item had ‘shipped’ the response was yes - in this case my shipped was equal the packaging and crating of the unit and may not be in the hands of the shipping company.  Nevertheless Copper Tailor will send the shipping tracking number in a few days.  It takes about 2 months from the time you confirm the dimensions until you receive it so plan early and make accommodations - it is worth it - never thought a hood could look this great (hammered bronzed copper) and it even is a talking point of beauty for our guests.\n",

Of course… OEM air filters were at least double the price.  So I got these two and placed them on each side. How I understand these work is say you were to place bananas in a brown paper bag, notice that they get ripe faster?  That is because the off-gassing of the banana is trapped and speeds up the process. This filter is supposed to remove these and other type gases through UV light. Supposedly this helps extend your fruits and vegetables by 1-2 weeks. If someone knows different please comment. It could just be some snake oil 🐍\n",

            "Document Sentence: After using my brand new dishwasher for four times I noticed that the silverware in the cutlery tray was dirty. It's not just that it wasn't properly clean. It was dirty, greasy and you could even see the color of the food. (I don't think I put anything in the cutlery tray the first times I used the dishwasher). Some of the dishes in the lower tray (including a tall glass) are somewhat dirty too. I called Bosch customer care and was told that the dishwasher needs rinse aid in order to wash (so just adding dish washer detergent doesn't get you clean dishes) and that they will charge me for the work of the technician if lack of rinse aid is the problem. Note that the product information doesn't include that it only washes if rinse aid is added.<br />I'm now washing the same load of dishes now for a third time on a row in the hopes that it solves the problem but bottomline is (1) a dishwasher should be able to wash dishes only with adequate detergent, (2) if additional items are NEEDED for the dishwasher to wash this should be clearly stated as part of the description of the product, and (3) nothing excuses rude customer care that passes customers the burden for problems with brand new items.<br />In a subsequent call to BOSCH customer care I was told that the dishwasher should work without rinse aid. A technician came to check my unit and he said that this washer ONLY works with dishwasher tablets, even if that's not written anywhere and the guide that comes with the dishwasher says you can use liquid dishwasher. I still don't know if it'll work with those (he refused to try it and just left), but at any rate if this dishwasher ONLY works with these items, that information must be provided upfront so you decide if you want to buy it or not. I feel like I've been sold a car and later been told that the car only works if I wear a red shirt.<br />You can see in the picture what items look like AFTER THREE CONSECUTIVE WASH CYCLES!\n",
